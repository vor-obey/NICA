    </h3>
    <p>
      I understand that if  i am injured in
      a way that falls under the definition of a NICA
      injury durring any NICA activity, an incident
      report will be submitted to the NICA Safety Study.
      An incident report is necessary if the injury requires one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A referral to a medical provider beyond on-site first-aid or EMS</li>
      <li>Time loss from training or competition beyond the day of injury</li>
      <li>Time loss from school or work</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For more information about the NICA Safety
      Study and the Nica Injury Definition, please see the
      <a href="ffff"> Nica Safety Study Webpage.</a>
